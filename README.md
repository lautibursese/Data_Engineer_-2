## Description
The present Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach/philosophy for data analysis that employs a variety of techniques (mostly graphical) to:

+ Maximize insight into a data set;
+ Uncover underlying structure;
+ Extract important variables;
+ Detect outliers and anomalies;
+ Test underlying assumptions;
+ Develop parsimonious models; and
+ Determine optimal factor settings.
